# SCAAMP
Security Configuration Assistant for Apache-MySQL-PHP

# What is SCAAMP All About?
Given the configuration paths for Apache HTTP server, PHP interpreter, and MySQL database server, SCAAMP automatically audits the three environments for possible configuration vulnerabilities. It generates an audit summary that shows current values of security-critical configration directives. On the same summary, it also shows the recommended values for each configuration directive. Finally, it allows automated fixing of configuration by changing values from "Unsafe" to "Safe" as per configuration security best practices.
